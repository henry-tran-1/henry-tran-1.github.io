    <h3>Values and Identity</h3>
    <p>
      My family came to New Zealand as refugees and although I was very young, I
      still remember the difficulties and struggles my parents went through to
      provide a life for my brother and I. My parents instilled in me the
      importance of hardwork and determination.<br /><br />
      Working in primary healthcare as an optometrist has taught me the value of
      patience, kindness and humility. These are now values I hold important to
      my identity.
    </p>

  <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px">
    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <p>
      I believe the DOPE personality test was quite accurate, and I would agree
      my strengths are:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px">
      <li>Hardworking</li>
      <li>Team player</li>
      <li>Friendly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I work well in a team environment, where I'm happy to learn from others
      and to teach others what I've learned. These traits should help me do well
      at DA bootcamp.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px">
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      I do tend to avoid confrontation and prefer to keep the peace. This may
      hinder my learning and development if I choose not to speak up if I'm
      having problems.<br />
      I also recognise that I can sometimes lose confidence if I go through long
      periods of struggle.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethics and Conflict resolution</h3>
    <p>
      When I worked in a corporate optometry practice, one area of contention
      was management's policy of pushing glasses sales. They would encourage us
      to recommend glasses even in cases where the patient may not have
      benefited.<br />
      I chose in the end not to adhere to these policies, and would sometimes
      fall short of my KPIs and bonuses. I remember at the time thinking that
      the reward of meeting expectations and monetary bonuses were not worth
      compromising my own values of sincerity and fairness. I look back
      favourably on most of my decisions in the clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would sometimes help Dad with projects he has around the house, but one
      of his big flaws (in my opinion) is his inability to take on constructive
      feedback.<br />
      Giving suggestions when I recognised problems/inefficient solutions were
      never received well, and eventually I would stop trying altogether.<br />
      Looking back now, I recognise my way of expressing these suggestions were
      probably blunt and not conducive to being heard as constructive
      feedback.<br />
      I would now approach these situations with more focus on empathy and
      listening to the other party.
