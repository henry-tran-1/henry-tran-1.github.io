    <h2 style="text-align: center">The CSS Box Model</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p style="text-align: left">
        The box model is important to know about in web design because all HTML
        elements can be considered boxes. <br />
        Each element is a box that consists of 4 different layers. These layers
        in order are:
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <div style="margin-right: 20px">
          <ul style="text-align: left">
            <li>
              <strong>Content </strong>(blue box):<br />
              This is the area where your content is displayed, e.g. texts and
              images.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Padding </strong>(green box):<br />
              This is the transparent space between the content area and the
              border. <br />
              Any background colour applied to the element will also display
              behind the padding space.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Border </strong>(yellow box):<br />
              This is the border that wraps around the content and padding
              space.<br />
              It is situated between the padding and the margin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Margin </strong>(orange box):<br />
              The margin is the last layer and wraps around the other three
              layers.<br />
              It is an invisible space around the box, that will push away other
              elements.<br />
              This has no background.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img
            src="../images/box-model.png"
            alt="Box Model"
            width="400"
            height="auto"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p style="text-align: left">There are also two types of box models:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>
          <strong>Standard box model:</strong> width/height attributes
          correspond to the content box, and then padding/borders are added on
          top. This is the default.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alternate box model:</strong> width/height attributes
          correspond to the total size of the content box, the padding box and
          the border boxes all added together.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div
      style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-right; margin-bottom: 0"
    >
      <p style="text-align: left">
        How do the margins of two elements/boxes <strong>interact</strong> with
        each other?
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <p style="max-width: 600px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 0">
          If there are two boxes, each with a margin of 50px, they would overlap
          as shown in the image to the right: they are separated by only 50px of
          space. The margins do not add up to make 100px of space.<br />
          This is because the elements can be as close to each other as they
          like, as long as there's enough space between them to satisfy each of
          their margin requirements. If there are two boxes with different
          margins, the space between them would be equal to the largest margin
          of the two.<br />
          I like to think of the margin attribute like a
          <strong>person's personal space</strong>. If two people both had a
          personal space of 2 metres, they would only have to be 2 metres away
          from each other to make both people happy.
