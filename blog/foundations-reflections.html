        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have learned more about my values, and what drives me to achieve
        higher goals.
        <br />I have learned that my brain is malleable, and with practice I can
        improve its ability. <br />I have learned I can enjoy meditation, and
        that it can help put my mind in a better place to learn.

      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Knowing your values and having good self awareness may give you insight
        on what your strengths and limitations are, which is important when
        putting together an effective learning plan. You can lean on your
        strengths, and have plan in place for your limitations. Having good
        empathy lets you better understand what struggles other students may be
        going through, and by helping them you can help yourself reinforce those
        same concepts.

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        That the human skills section has not only been beneficial for just
        learning programming, but has also been beneficial in other aspects too,
        e.g. being more aware of my values; thinking about ways to improve my
        wellbeing (Te Whare Tapa Wha).

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Self reflection is really challenging, and especially trying to put it
        formally into words.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        These human skills can improve our mindset and understanding for
        learning, which puts us in a better place to learn difficult skills such
        as programming. It will make us better people who will have not only the
        necessary coding ability, but also important EQ ability to perform well
        in the Tech industry. It essence, it makes us a more hireable candidate.

      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time?
        <br />
        Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
        Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The human skills section has been an important part of the learning
        journey so far, which has worked in complement to the tech skills
        section. There's only so much time you can put into the programming side
        before only getting back marginal benefit; this time has been better
        spent doing the things we learned in the human skills section. This has
        helped with more efficient learning and improving other necessary
        skills.
