      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        It is the ability to monitor and control your own emotions and feelings,
        as well as reading another person's emotions and be able to handle
        relationships with others in a fair and empathetic way.

      <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional quotient (EQ) refers to your emotional intelligence and how
        you can use your awareness of your own and other's emotions to guide
        your behaviour. These are better known as your social skills, such as:
        regulating your emotions; empathy for others; and communicating
        effectively.<br />
        Intelligence quotient (IQ) refers to your intellectual ability, such as
        your capacity to learn, comprehend and apply knowledge.<br />
        They are both important skills: EQ helps you navigate social and
        emotional situations while IQ helps you use your cognitive ability to
        understand and overcome challenges.

      <h3>What is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        Having a strong EQ is important because it comes with many benefits:
        better at communication; better at using your social awareness in
        problem solving; and better at regulating your emotions which allows you
        to perform at a higher level. All these benefits will make someone a
        better learner and a better candidate for hire.
