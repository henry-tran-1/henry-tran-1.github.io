    <h2 style="text-align: center">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a software developer and the destination I have in
        mind is the health sector. I'm hoping to gain skills in both programming
        but also human skills that will make me a more attractive candidate for
        hiring.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong
        >What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?</strong
      >
      <p>
        I feel I had a good gauge on what my strengths and limitations were in
        the Foundations Learning plan.
        <br />I think my strengths in working well in a team environment will
        remain useful at bootcamp where I'll be with my peers in person. I do
        worry how I will handle the bootcamp when the course becomes more
        intense and the content becomes heavier.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong
        >What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?</strong
      >
      <p>
        Keeping up positive habits, having a healthy mindset and staying on top
        of the material. Bootcamp will run for a longer time, and will likely
        involve more difficult content and concepts. I worry that when I find
        the course to be too challenging, I may lose the momentum I've gained so
        far in Foundations.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong
        >What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
      >
      <p>
        I would like to work on being more assertive and be better at giving and
        taking feedback.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
      <p>
        Simliar to in foundations, I have an expectation from the course and
        facilitators to help guide me in the right direction for my learning and
        to let me know if I'm no longer on this path. I would like to rely on
        them to help guide me through roadblocks I may encounter.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>
      <p>
        My expectations from myself is to keep my mindset positive and open, and
        to continue working hard even when it's challenging.
        <br />For programming-related issues, I will first rely on the tech
        facilitators (during tech-ins or during the weekday when there is
        available time). For other issues, I have my family to rely on - they
        are a strong support system for me. <br />I will continue to devote my
        full attention to the DA course, and am committed to staying on top of
        all the material and recommended tech + human exercises. <br />
        I am commited to maintaining a positive attitude and openness with my
        fellow students and teachers, and all other people I encounter on this
        journey.

      <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a software developer and work full time in the tech
        industry. I would like to eventually work again in the healthcare sector
        but as a programmer.

        >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning</strong
      >
      <p>
        Strengths: Good grit and determination; good initiative in seeking out
        information I want to know; work well in team environment.
        <br />
        Limitations: Tends to avoid confrontation; sometimes prone to being
        overwhelmed and losing confidence.

        I would like to develop better discipline and healthier study habits.

      <strong
        >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
        programme.</strong
      >
      <p>
        I am committed to adhering to the recommended timeboxes and content in
        the DA foundation and bootcamp. I will aim to stay up-to-date on
        learning competencies and not fall behind; and not forge ahead and risk
        burnout. I will be dedicated to attending the weekly homegroup meetings
        and find time to ask questions when I am struggling. If the things I am
        struggling with are technical-based, I will ask for help in my cohort
        discord, the foundation help desk, or facilitators. If the things I'm
        struggling with are more personal, I have a strong support system in my
        family whom I can rely on when needed.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong
        >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
        way</strong
      >
      <p>
        If I feel I'm unable to solve these issues with the above methods, I
        will alert the facilitators in a timely manner and look for other
        solutions together.

    <div class="paragraph">
      <strong
        >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong
      >
      <p>
        I have an expectation that the course and facilitators will help steer
        me in the right direction in my software development journey, and to let
        me know if I'm wandering away form this path. I would also like to use
        the facilitators as a way to help me move past mental blocks in my
        learning when I encounter them. Perhaps something that would have taken
        me a long time to learn on my own, may be expedited by someone who has
        been through similar issues.

      <p>
        No major scheduling problems that I can forsee. I'm dedicating my full
        focus on the course.
