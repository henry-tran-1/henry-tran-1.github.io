      <em>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        My goal is to become a software developer and work full time in the tech
        industry. I would like to eventually work again in the healthcare sector
        but as a programmer.

        Strengths: Good grit and determination; good initiative in seeking out

      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        I am committed to adhering to the recommended timeboxes and content in
        the DA foundation and bootcamp. I will aim to stay up-to-date on
        learning competencies and not fall behind; and not forge ahead and risk
        burnout. I will be dedicated to attending the weekly homegroup meetings
        and find time to ask questions when I am struggling. If the things I am
        struggling with are technical-based, I will ask for help in my cohort
        discord, the foundation help desk, or facilitators. If the things I'm
        struggling with are more personal, I have a strong support system in my
        family whom I can rely on when needed.

      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        If I feel I'm unable to solve these issues with the above methods, I
        will alert the facilitators in a timely manner and look for other
        solutions together.

      <em>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</em>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        I have an expectation that the course and facilitators will help steer
        me in the right direction in my software development journey, and to let
        me know if I'm wandering away form this path. I would also like to use
        the facilitators as a way to help me move past mental blocks in my learning
        when I encounter them. Perhaps something that would have taken me a long
        time to learn on my own, may be expedited by someone who has been
        through similar issues.

        No major scheduling problems that I can forsee. I'm dedicating my full
        focus on the course.
