      <h3>Stuck on a simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        There was an exercise in sprint 4 (JS Kata) where we were given a list
        of items (an array of objects), in which one of these items contained a
        hiding Scooby (from Scooby Doo).
        <br />
        We were tasked with writing a function (short piece of code
        instructions) to find which item Scooby was hiding in. I wanted to use a
        method which could look in all these items (array.find()) for a hiding
        Scooby, but just could not get it to work correctly.
        <br />
        I tried to talk out the problem, and writing pseudocode but it didn't
        seem to help in this scenario. It turned out I was using the method
        incorrectly. When I read the console.log, it turned out my method was
        not returning any information at all (undefined). I looked at my code,
        and confirmed that I had asked the function to return the item. That was
        when I realised that I had forgotten to ask the method to return the
        item to the function so that it could then pass this item along.
        <br />
        It felt really frustrating because nothing I tried seemed to work, but
        immense relief when it finally worked correctly.
        <br />
        I learned it was important to read the documentation on methods
        properly, and to pay more attention to console.log messages.

      <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
      <p>
        Another exercise in sprint 4 we had to complete was to write a function
        that could return a string of letters in reverse order.
        <br />
        I set out to tackle this problem with pseudocode first, which forced me
        to think about the big picture before starting to write any code. It
        worked very well as I then only had to complete the solution in smaller
        chunks that when combined together solved the entire problem.
        <br />
        It felt satisfying to complete the exercise in this way because it
        always felt like I was making progress, instead of being stuck multiple
        times. And also fortunately, the code solved first time without having
        to do any debugging.
        <br />
        I learned the benefit of laying out a good plan before starting to write
        out any code.

      <h3>Different problem-solving processes</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Pseudocode: </strong>confident at this and getting better.<br />
        <strong>Trying something: </strong>this used to be my default, but
        trying to branch into more reliable methods.<br />
        <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>confident, has worked well in the
        past.<br />
        <strong>Reading error messages: </strong>somewhat confident, but still
        find some of the language difficult to understand<br />
        <strong>Console.logging: </strong>confident, will use it a lot to make
        sure my code is doing what I expect it to.<br />
        <strong>Googling: </strong>confident, especially as I start to recognise
        websites that do a good job of catering to new developers.<br />
        <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>somewhat confident, but not
        fully comfortable.<br />
        <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>confident, facilitators have
        been very approachable.<br />
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>somewhat
        confident, but improving.<br />

        I had struggles with implementing some of the stretch options in the
        javascript cafe challenge. I felt that since they were stretch/bonus
        challenges, they were something I should try to figure out for my own. I
        will probably just post in the foundation discord chat (towards end of
        the week) instead of being frustrated for an afternoon.
