      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

        ><br />
        By knowing that your intelligence is malleable and that you can
        physically alter your brain and its connections, you can improve your
        ability to learn and perform better at tasks you might previously have
        thought impossible. The results of a study
        <em>(Child Development, 2007)</em> showed that students did significant
        better than their peers in a control group, when they understood this
        concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How you might use this for your own benefit</em><br />
        Understanding neuroplasticity means understanding I can improve my brain
        function and its ability to learn. I consequently know that I am not
        limited by what I perceive to be the ceiling of my capabilities.<br />
        When I encounter difficulties in the DA course or problems that seem
        impossible, I know that eventually I'll be able to handle them and think
        of solutions that weren't obvious to me at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ways to increase neuroplasticity</em><br />
        One way is to practice and repeat a certain activity many times. This
        stimulates your brain (specifically the neural pathway that is
        responsible for this activity) and will over time, strengthen its
        connections. This results in a stronger and more efficient pathway that
        is capable of better performance.<br />
        Another way is to tap into already-existing pathways. This can be done
        by integrating that activity with another subject that you are already
        familar with (thus already having a strengthened neural pathway). Or by
        thinking of difficult concepts in analogies that you are familiar with
        and are easier to understand (and again already having an
        already-existing neural pathway).

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        <em>What is it, and why is it relevant</em><br />
        A growth mindset is when you can react positively/constructively after
        encountering an obstacle or a tough challenge: you understand that you
        aren't able to overcome this challenge at the moment, but you can learn
        to eventually. A fixed mindset is when you react in a negative manner:
        you do not believe you can improve your ability/intelligence to do so at
        any point and therefore give up.<br />
        This is relevant because we will likely encounter many difficult
        concepts and challenges in this DA course and we should react to them by
        improving ourselves as opposed to giving up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What changed for me after exploring this topic</em><br />
        By knowing there are studies and evidence that support this idea, it
        definitely makes me more determined to go through life with a growth
        mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How to use this concept in my own learning journey</em><br />
        I will treat obstacles and challenges as opportunities where I can
        further develop my programming ability. With the help of the course and
        facilitators, I am confident and believe that I will eventually overcome
        all these future roadblocks.

        This video from Carol Dweck describing growth vs fixed mindset helped
        convince me:<br />

      <h3>Changes to my learning plan and strategy</h3>
      <p>
        I will look to adjust my learning plan so it is more flexible and allows
        for time when I encounter exercises/concepts that I struggle with. By
        giving myself this time, I will be able to practice and improve the
        relevant neural pathways. And knowing that my ability to learn is
        malleable, this strategy will give myself a better chance to grow and
        develop myself.
